**Go Microservices For Bug Bounty**

Welcome to **Hunt**! This project is a collection of Go microservices designed to assist in bug bounty hunting by automating various security assessments.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories and scripts:

- **LFIDetection/**: Detects Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities.
- **MassDNS/**: Performs mass DNS resolution to discover subdomains.
- **NucleiVulnerabilityScanning/**: Utilizes Nuclei for vulnerability scanning.
- **OpenRedirectCheck/**: Checks for open redirect vulnerabilities.
- **ParameterJSExtraction/**: Extracts parameters from JavaScript files.
- **PortScanning/**: Conducts port scanning to identify open ports.
- **SubdomainExploiting/**: Exploits discovered subdomains.
- **URLCollection/**: Collects URLs for further analysis.
- **XSSDetection/**: Detects Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.

Additionally, the repository includes various `run_*.sh` scripts to execute the corresponding services via cronjobs. These times can be changed in order to preserve IP's and also manually manage the cost quickly. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Update Paths  

Before running any scripts, **ensure that all paths are updated to match your local environment**.  
The scripts and configurations may contain hardcoded paths that need to be adjusted for your system.

## üåç Infrastructure Setup

This project utilizes multiple **Vultr VPS instances** to distribute scanning efforts and avoid detection from using a single IP address. 

### üíæ Data Synchronization  

- A **PostgreSQL database** is used to store collected scan results and information.
- Multiple **Vultr VPS instances** are set up, each responsible for scanning different targets.
- A **primary VPS** acts as the central repository, **rsyncing** data from all scanning VPS instances every night. This helps consolidate data without performing scans from a single IP address, which could lead to bans or rate limits.
- The setup was designed to be **cost-effective**, maintaining continuous scanning for around **$100/month**.

### üîÑ Automated Data Collection  

Each night, the system fetches target data from multiple sources, including:

- **HackerOne**
- **Bugcrowd**
- **Intigriti**
- **YesWeHack**

This is achieved via their respective APIs and updated into the database. The relevant domains are pulled and stored in a file like so:
